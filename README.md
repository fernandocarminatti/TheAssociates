# The Associates


# Associates

Idea behind it is just keep track of a huge list of Associates from a local hospital.


Just admins can add/remove an Associate, keep track of changes (add/update/removal).


Normal user can fetch Associates simple list or if already implemented have a list of news with pagination.


Upgrade it to have a post sections for some news about the hospital having custom messages along with contracts/images if they exist.


For the future have a separate front-end to fetch data.
